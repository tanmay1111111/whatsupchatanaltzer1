Hey everyone! I am excited to share with you a recent project I worked on called "Whatsup Chat Analyzer." This web application, built using Streamlit, allows users to analyze their WhatsApp chats in a comprehensive and user-friendly manner.

The first step in this project is importing the chat file, which can be easily exported without media from the WhatsApp chat settings. Once the file is imported, the application provides various insightful analyses.

Using the power of pandas, we perform a deep analysis of the chat, including total messages, words, links shared, and media shared. These metrics give a comprehensive overview of the chat's content and activity.

To better understand the chat dynamics over time, we provide visualizations such as the daily timeline and monthly timeline. These graphs enable users to identify patterns and trends in the chat activity. Additionally, we determine the most busy day and month, highlighting the periods with the highest chat volume.

The application also includes a heatmap that showcases the time and date when most chats are conducted. This visualization allows users to identify the peak hours and days of chat engagement.

Another interesting analysis is the percentage of chats contributed by each user in the group. This metric provides insights into individual participation levels and helps understand the overall dynamics within the chat.

Furthermore, we dive into the world of emojis by analyzing the most commonly used ones in the chat. We represent this data using a pie chart, allowing users to visualize the distribution of emojis and their frequency of usage.

Overall, the Whatsup Chat Analyzer offers a comprehensive group analysis as well as specific user analysis. It provides valuable insights into chat activity, engagement patterns, and user contributions. This project combines the power of data analysis and visualization to offer an in-depth understanding of WhatsApp conversations.
